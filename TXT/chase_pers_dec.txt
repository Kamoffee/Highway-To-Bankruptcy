Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nThese changes may affect your currently scheduled Autosave transfers and the Chase SavingsS\u2122 account monthly service\nfee waiver.\n\nBeginning February 1, 2024:\n\ne Existing safety net and custom goals will be discontinued. You'll need to set up these transfers again as general\nsavings goals.\n\ne Daily account transfers will be discontinued, but we have other scheduling options to help support your savings\ngoals, including transfers as often as every week or when you receive a deposit.\n\ne You'll no longer be able to pause transfers that are set up to your savings account on a recurring basis. You can\nstill pause your scheduled transfers that occur when you receive a deposit. You can still cancel your transfer at\nany time.\n\ne There will no longer be an option to pause a transfer if your checking balance drops below a specified amount. To\nhelp prevent an overdraft from happening from an Autosave transfer, we'll skip your transfer if you don\u2019t have\nenough money in your checking account or linked Overdraft Protection backup account. Please remember, you\nmay have other transactions that could still cause an overdraft if you don\u2019t have enough money in your account.\n\ne Transfers from a Chase checking account to an investment account will now be viewable and managed through\nPay & Transfer instead of Autosave. If you have transfers to an investment account set up daily or when you get\na deposit, those will end.\n\nIf you have a goal or transfer affected by these changes, here\u2019s what you can do before February 1, 2024:\ne If you have a daily transfer, custom goal or safety net goal, you'll need to create a new general savings goal to\nyour savings account.\ne \u2014 If you don\u2019t create a new Autosave transfer by this date, your current transfers will be discontinued. You can\nalways set up new Autosave transfers in the future.\n\nSpecial note for Chase Savings\u00ae\" accounts that use Autosave to waive the $5 Monthly Service Fee:\nPlease review your currently scheduled Autosave transfers and if needed, create a new repeating general savings goal of at\nleast $25 per month so you can continue receiving the monthly service fee waiver benefit.\n\nAs a reminder, you can still waive the Chase Savings\u00ae\u201c Monthly Service Fee when you have any one of the following during\neach monthly statement period:\n\u00a2 Abalance at the beginning of each day of $300 or more in this account, or\ne $25 or more in total Autosave or other repeating automatic transfers from your personal Chase checking account\n(available only through chase.com or Chase Mobile), or\ne AChase College Checking\u00ae account linked to this account for Overdraft Protection, or\ne \u2014 An account owner who is an individual younger than 18, or\n\u00a2  Alinked Chase Premier Plus Checking\u2122, Chase Sapphire\u201d Checking or Chase Private Client Checking\u201d\naccount\n\nWe're here to help you stay on track with your savings.
