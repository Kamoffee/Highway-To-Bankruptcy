A few things to\nremember: Your Statement Balance may not reflect spending that occurred at the start or end of your statement period\nbecause some transactions take 1-3 days after the transaction date to post. Available Credit plus Statement Balance\nmay not exactly equal your Credit Line because recent transactions can impact Available Credit (for example, some\nmerchantslike hotels and car rental companiesmay reserve part of your credit line until full payment has been\ncalculated).\n\n9 Redemption Activity This Period is the total amount of Rewards you redeemed during the statement period and\nincludes Cashback Bonus partners, gift cards, account credits, electronic deposits and charitable donations.\n\f\u00a9 Your Cashback Bonus is the amount of reward that you have accrued as of this statement.
