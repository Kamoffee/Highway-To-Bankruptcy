Member FDIC\n\n \n\nPage 4 of 6\n\fCHASE \u00a7\n\nJune 16, 2023 through July 18, 2023\nPrimary Account: 000000697827678\n\nOverdraft and Overdraft Fee Information for Your Chase Checking Account\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Overdrafts and Overdraft Fees\n\nAn overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway.\nWhether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our\nnightly processing, we take your previous end of day\u2019s balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available\nfor use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we\nsubtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day\nmay not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly\nprocessing.\n\nWe pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions\npresented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft,\nyour transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in\n\nthe Deposit Account Agreement.\n\nWe can cover your overdrafts in three different ways:\n1. We have a Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with your account.\n2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our\nStandard Overdraft Practice. You can contact us to learn more.\n8. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage\u00ae, which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card\ntransactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice.\n\nThis notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage.\n\n\u00a2 What is the Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with my account?\nWe do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions:\n\u2014 Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number\n\u2014 Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships)\n\n\u00ab What is Chase Debit Card Coverage?\nIf you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we may authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card\ntransactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice.\n\n\u00a2 What fees will | be charged if Chase pays my overdraft?\nIf we authorize and pay an overdraft, we'll charge you a $34 Overdraft Fee (may also be referred to as Insufficient\nFunds Fee) per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your\naccount balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102).\n\nWe won't charge you an Overdraft Fee in the following circumstances:\n\n\u2014 With Chase Overdraft Assist\u201c, we won't charge an Overdraft Fee if you\u2019re overdrawn by $50 or less at the\nend of the business day OR if you're overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to\noverdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to\nmake a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible\nChase checking accounts.\n\n\u2014 We won't charge an Overdraft Fee for transactions that are $5 or less.\n\n\u2014 We won't charge an Overdraft Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a\nsufficient available balance in your account.\n\n\u2014 For Chase Sapphire\u201d Checking and Chase Private Client Checking\u2122 accounts, there are no Overdraft\nFees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days\nduring the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this\ncounts toward the four business days when an Overdraft Fee will not be charged.\n\n\u00a2 What if | want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions?\nIf you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please\nmake your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. You can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at\nany time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile\u00ae to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935\n(or at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.
