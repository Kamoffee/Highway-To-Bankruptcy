Late payments, missed payments or other defaults\n\u2018on your Account may be reflected in your credit report. If you think we have reported\ninaccurate information to a credit bureau, please write to us at Chase Card Services\nP.O, Box 15369, Wilmington, DE 19850-5369,\n\nTo Service And Manage Any Of Your Account(s): By providing my mobile phone\nnumber, | am giving permission to be contacted at that number about all of my\naccounts by JPMorgan Chase and companies working on its behalf, My consent\nallows the use of text messages, artificial or prerecorded voice messages and\nautomatic dialing technology for informational and account servicing, but not for\nsales or telemarketing, Message and data rates may apply.\n\nAuthorization To Convert Your Check To An Electronic Transter Debit: When you\nprovide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your\ncheck to make a one-time electronic fund transfer fromm your account or to process\nthe payment as a check. Your bank account may be debited as soon as the same day\nwe receive your payment. You will not receive your check back from your institution.\n\nConditional Payments: Any payment check or other form of payment that you send\nus for less than the full balance due that is marked \u201cpaid in full\u201d or contains a similar\nnotation, or that you otherwise tender in full satisfaction of a disputed amount,\nmust be sent to Card Services, P.O. Box 15049, Wilmington, DE 19850-5049. We\nreserve all our rights regarding these payments (e.g., if it is determined there is no\nvalid dispute or if any such check is received at any other address, we may accept\nthe check and you will still owe any remaining balance). We may refuse to accept\nany such payment by returning it to you, not cashing it or destroying it. All other\npayments that you make should be sent to the regular Payment address shown on\nthis statement.\n\nAnnual Renewal Notice: If your Account Agreement has an annual membership\nfee, you are responsible for it every year your Account is open. We will add your\nannual membership fee to your monthly billing statement once a year, whether or not\nyou use your account. Your annual membership fee will be added to your purchase\nbalance and may incur interest, The annual membership fee is non-refundable unless\nyou notify us that you wish to close your account within 30 days or one billing cycle\n(whichever is less) after we provide the statement on which the annual membership\nfee is billed. Your payment of the annual membership fee does not affect our rights\nto close your Account and to limit your right to make transactions on your Account.\nIf your Account is closed by you or us, the annual membership fee will no longer be\nbilled to your Account.\n\nCalculation Of Balance Subject To Interest Rate: To figure your periodic interest\ncharges for each billing cycle when a daily periodic rate(s) applies, we use the\ndaily balance method (including new transactions). To figure your periodic interest\ncharges for each billing cycle when a monthly periodic rate(s) applies, we use the\naverage daily balance method (including new transactions). For an explanation of\neither method, or questions about a particular interest charge calculation on your\nstatement, please call us at the toll free customer service phone number listed above.\n\nWe calculate periodic interest charges separately for each feature {for example,\npurchases, balance transfers, cash advances or overdraft advances). These\ncalculations may combine different categories with the same periodic rates. Variable\nrates will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate or such index described\nin your Account Agreement. There is a transaction fee for each balance transfer,\n\ncash advance, or check transaction in the amount stated in your Account Agreement.\nThere is a foreign transaction fee of 3% of the U.S. dollar amount of any foreign\ntransaction for some accounts, Please see your Account Agreement for information\nabout these fees.\n\nWe add transactions and fees to your daily balance no earlier than:\n\n1. the date of the transaction \u2014for new purchases, balance transfers, overdraft\nadvances, cash advances, or My Chase Loans;\n\n2. the date the payee deposits the check \u2014 for new cash advance checks or\nbalance transfer checks,\n\n3. the date of a related transaction, the date they are posted to your account, or\nthe last day of the billing cycle, whichever we may choose \u2014 for fees\n\nHow To Avoid Paying Interest On Purchases: Your due date will be a minimum of 21\ndays after the close of each billing cycle. If you pay your account {or Interest Saving\nBalance) in full each billing period by the date and time due, no interest is charged\n\u2018on new purchases month to month. Also, we will not impose interest charges on any\nportion of a purchase balance you repay while that balance is subject to an interest-\nfree period, Subject to any interest-free period for new purchases, we will begin\ncharging interest from the date a transaction (including any balance transfer, cash\nadvance or overdraft advance), fee or interest charge is added to your daily balance\nuntil your account is paid in full. Because we apply payments in excess of your\nminimum payment first to higher rate balances, you may not be able to avoid interest\ncharges on new purchases if you have another balance at a higher interest rate unless\nyou pay your balance (or Interest Saving Balance) in full each month.\n\nCredit Limit: If you want to inquire about your options to help prevent your account\nfrom exceeding your credit limit, please call the number on the back of your card,\n\nWhat To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement: If you think there\nis an error on your statement, write to us on a separate sheet at Customer Service,\nP.O.
