If you pay your New Balance in full by the due date\neach month, we will not charge interest on new transactions that post to the purchase balance. If\nyou have been paying in full without Interest Charges, but fail to pay your next New Balance in full,\nwe will charge interest on the unpaid balance. Interest Charges on Cash Advances and Special\nTransfers start on the transaction date. Promotional offers may allow you to pay less than the total\nNew Balance and avoid paying interest on new transactions that post to your purchase balance.\nSee the front of your statement for additional information.\n\nHow is the Interest Charge Determined? Interest Charges accrue from the date of the\ntransaction, date the transaction is processed or the first day of the Billing Cycle. Interest accrues\ndaily on every unpaid amount until it is paid in full. Interest accrued during a Billing Cycle posts to\nyour account at the end of the Billing cycle and appears on your next statement. You may owe\nInterest Charges even if you pay the entire New Balance one month, but did not do so the prior\nmonth. Once you start accruing Interest Charges, you generally must pay your New Balance in full\ntwo consecutive Billing Cycles before Interest Charges stop being posted to your Statement.\nInterest Charges are added to the corresponding segment of your account.\n\nDo you assess a Minimum Interest Charge? We may assess a minimum Interest Charge of\n$0.00 for each Billing Cycle if your account is subject to an Interest Charge.\n\nHow do you Calculate the Interest Charge? We use a method called Average Daily Balance\n(including new transactions).\n\n1. First, for each segment we take the beginning balance each day and add in new transactions and\nthe periodic Interest Charge on the previous day's balance. Then we subtract any payments and\ncredits for that segment as of that day. The result is the daily balance for each segment. However, if\nyour previous statement balance was zero or a credit amount, new transactions which post to your\npurchase segment are not added to the daily balance.\n\n2. Next, for each segment, we add the daily balances together and divide the sum by the number of\ndays in the Billing Cycle. The result is the Average Daily Balance for each segment.\n\n3. At the end of each Billing Cycle, we multiply your Average Daily Balance for each segment by\nthe daily periodic rate (APR divided by 365) for that segment, and then we multiply the result by the\nnumber of days in the Billing Cycle. We add the Interest Charges for all segments together. The\nresult is your total Interest Charge for the Billing Cycle.\n\nThe Average Daily Balance is referred to as the Balance Subject to Interest Rate in the Interest\nCharge Calculation section of this Statement.\n\nNOTE: Due to rounding or a minimum Interest Charge, this calculation may vary slightly from the\nInterest Charge actually assessed.\n\nHow can | Avoid Membership Fees? If a Renewal Notice is printed on this statement, you may\navoid paying an annual membership Fee by contacting Customer Service no later than 45 days\nafter the last day in the Billing Cycle covered by this statement to request that we close your\naccount. To avoid paying a monthly membership Fee, close your account and we will stop\nassessing your monthly membership Fee.\n\nHow can | Close My Account? You can contact Customer Service anytime to request that we\nclose your account.\n\n(B)) Pay online at capitalone.com\n\n( el ) Pay using the Capital One mobile app\n\n \n\n) ) Customer Service 1-800-227-4825\n\nChanging your mailing address?\n\nYou can change your address by signing into your account online or by calling\nCustomer Service.\n\nAny written request on this form will not be honored.\n\nHow do you Process Payments? When you make a payment, you authorize us to initiate an\n\nACH or electronic payment that will be debited from your bank account or other related\n\naccount. When you provide a check or check information to make a payment, you authorize us\nto use information from the check to make a one-time ACH or other electronic transfer from\n\nyour bank account. We may also process it as a check transaction. Funds may be withdrawn\n\nfrom your bank account as soon as the same day we process your payment.\n\nHow do you Apply My Payment? We generally apply payments up to your Minimum\nPayment first to the balance with the lowest APR (including 0% APR), and then to balances\nwith higher APRs. We apply any part of your payment exceeding your Minimum Payment to\nthe balance with the highest APR, and then to balances with lower APRs.\n\nBilling Rights Summary (Does not Apply to Small Business Accounts)\n\nWhat To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement: If you think there is an\nerror on your statement, write to us at:\n\nP.O.

To use this right, the following must be true:\n\n1) You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash\nadvances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify;\nand\n\n2) You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.\n\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in\nwriting at: P.O.
