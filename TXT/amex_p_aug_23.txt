Payments we receive after 5 p.m. will\nnot be credited to your Account until the next day. Payments must also: (1)\ninclude the remittance coupon from your statement; (2) be made with a\nsingle check drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a\nnegotiable instrument payable in US dollars and clearable through the US\nbanking system; and (3) include your Account number. If your payment\ndoes not meet all of the above requirements, crediting may be delayed and\nyou may incur late payment fees and additional interest charges. Electronic\npayments must be made through an electronic payment method payable\nin US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. Please do not\nsend post-dated checks as they will be deposited upon receipt. Any\nrestrictive language on a payment we accept will have no effect on us\nwithout our express prior written approval. We will re-present to your\nfinancial institution any payment that is returned unpaid. You may pay\nmore than the Minimum Payment Due, up to your New Balance, at any\ntime.\n\nPermission for Electronic Withdrawal: (1) When you send a check for\npayment, you give us permission to electronically withdraw your payment\nfrom your deposit or other asset account. We will process checks\nelectronically by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number,\naccount number and check serial number to your financial institution,\nunless the check is not processable electronically or a less costly process is\navailable. When we process your check electronically, your payment may\nbe withdrawn from your deposit or other asset account as soon as the same\nday we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check\nwith your deposit or other asset account statement. If we cannot collect the\nfunds electronically we may issue a draft against your deposit or other asset\naccount for the amount of the check. (2) By using Pay By Computer, Pay By\nPhone or any other electronic payment service of ours, you give us\npermission to electronically withdraw funds from the deposit or other asset\naccount you specify in the amount you request. Payments using such\nservices of ours received after 8:00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the\nnext day.\n\nHow We Calculate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance (ADB)\nmethod (including new transactions) to calculate the balance on which we\ncharge interest on your Account. Call the Customer Care number on page 3\nfor more information about this balance computation method and how\nresulting interest charges are determined. The method we use to figure the\nADB and interest results in daily compounding of interest.\n\nPaying Interest: Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each\nbilling period. We will not charge you interest on your purchases if you pay\neach month your entire balance (or Adjusted Balance if applicable) by the\ndue date each month. We will charge you interest on cash advances and\n(unless otherwise disclosed) balance transfers beginning on the transaction\ndate.\n\nForeign Currency Charges: If you make a Charge in a foreign currency, we\nwill convert it into US dollars on the date we or our agents process it. We\nwill charge a fee of 2.70% of the converted US dollar amount. We will\nchoose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date, unless a\nparticular rate is required by law. The conversion rate we use is no more\nthan the highest official rate published by a government agency or the\nhighest interbank rate we identify from customary banking sources on the\nconversion date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates in\neffect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments\n(such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such establishments use.\n\nChange of Address, phone number, email\n\n- Online at www.americanexpress.com/updatecontactinfo\n- Via mobile device\n- Voice automated: call the number on the back of your card\n\n- For name, company name, and foreign address or phone changes, please call Customer Care\n\nPlease do not add any written communication or address change on this stub\n\nCredit Balance: A credit balance (designated CR) shown on this statement\nrepresents money owed to you. If within the six-month period following\nthe date of the first statement indicating the credit balance you do not\nrequest a refund or charge enough to use up the credit balance, we will\nsend you a check for the credit balance within 30 days if the amount is\n$1.00 or more.\n\nCredit Reporting: We may report information about your Account to credit\nbureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your\nAccount may be reflected in your credit report.\n\nWhat To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement\n\nIf you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:\n\nAmerican Express, PO Box 981535, El Paso TX 79998-1535\n\nYou may also contact us on the Web: www.americanexpress.com\n\nIn your letter, give us the following information:\n\n- Account information: Your name and account number.\n\n- Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.\n\n- Description of Problem: If you think there is an error on your bill,\ndescribe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.\n\nYou must contact us within 60 days after the error appeared on your\nstatement.\n\nYou must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You\nmay call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential\nerrors and you may have to pay the amount in question.\n\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following\nare true:\n\n- We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as\ndelinquent on that amount.\n\n- The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may\ncontinue to charge you interest on that amount. But, if we determine that\nwe made a mistake, you will not have to pay the amount in question or any\ninterest or other fees related to that amount.\n\n- While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible\nfor the remainder of your balance.\n\n- We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.\n\nYour Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased\nwith your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the\nproblem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the\nremaining amount due on the purchase.\n\nTo use this right, all of the following must be true:\n\n1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100\nmiles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have\nbeen more than $50. (Note: Neither of these is necessary if your purchase\nwas based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the\ncompany that sold you the goods or services.)\n\n2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made\nwith cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit\ncard account do not qualify.\n\n3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.\n\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the\npurchase, contact us in writing or electronically at:\n\nAmerican Express, PO Box 981535, El Paso TX 79998-1535\nwww.americanexpress.com\n\nWhile we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as\ndiscussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our\ndecision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay\nwe may report you as delinquent.\n\nPay Your Bill with AutoPay\n\nDeduct your payment from your bank\naccount automatically each month.\n\n- Avoid late fees\n| 7 Save time\n\nVisit americanexpress.com/autopay\n\ntoday to enroll.\n\n \n\nFor information on how we protect your\nprivacy and to set your communication\nand privacy choices, please visit\nwww.americanexpress.com/privacy.\n\fBlue Cash Everyday\u00ae from American Express p. 3/8\n\n \n\nVICTOR A MIRON\n\n \n\n \n\nClosing Date 08/11/23 Account Ending 3-35008\nCustomer Care & Billing Inquiries 1-888-258-3741 . .\n\nInternational Collect 1-336-393-1111 E] Website: americanexpress.com\n\nCash Advance at ATMs Inquiries 1-800-CASH-NOW\n\nLarge Print & Braille Statements 1-888-258-3741 Customer Care Payments\n& Billing Inquiries | PO BOX 6031\nP.O.

This is called\n\"trailing interest\". Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that\nhappens, we charge interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest\non purchases by paying your balance in full (or if you have a Plan balance, by paying your Adjusted Balance on your billing statement) by\nthe due date each month.
