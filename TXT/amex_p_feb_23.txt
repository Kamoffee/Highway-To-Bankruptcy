Payments we receive after 5 p.m. will\nnot be credited to your Account until the next day. Payments must also: (1)\ninclude the remittance coupon from your statement; (2) be made with a\nsingle check drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a\nnegotiable instrument payable in US dollars and clearable through the US\nbanking system; and (3) include your Account number. If your payment\ndoes not meet all of the above requirements, crediting may be delayed and\nyou may incur late payment fees and additional interest charges. Electronic\npayments must be made through an electronic payment method payable\nin US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. Please do not\nsend post-dated checks as they will be deposited upon receipt. Any\nrestrictive language on a payment we accept will have no effect on us\nwithout our express prior written approval. We will re-present to your\nfinancial institution any payment that is returned unpaid. You may pay\nmore than the Minimum Payment Due, up to your New Balance, at any\ntime.\n\nPermission for Electronic Withdrawal: (1) When you send a check for\npayment, you give us permission to electronically withdraw your payment\nfrom your deposit or other asset account. We will process checks\nelectronically by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number,\naccount number and check serial number to your financial institution,\nunless the check is not processable electronically or a less costly process is\navailable. When we process your check electronically, your payment may\nbe withdrawn from your deposit or other asset account as soon as the same\nday we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check\nwith your deposit or other asset account statement. If we cannot collect the\nfunds electronically we may issue a draft against your deposit or other asset\naccount for the amount of the check. (2) By using Pay By Computer, Pay By\nPhone or any other electronic payment service of ours, you give us\npermission to electronically withdraw funds from the deposit or other asset\naccount you specify in the amount you request. Payments using such\nservices of ours received after 8:00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the\nnext day.\n\nHow We Calculate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance (ADB)\nmethod (including new transactions) to calculate the balance on which we\ncharge interest on your Account. Call the Customer Care number on page 3\nfor more information about this balance computation method and how\nresulting interest charges are determined. The method we use to figure the\nADB and interest results in daily compounding of interest.\n\nPaying Interest: Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each\nbilling period. We will not charge you interest on your purchases if you pay\neach month your entire balance (or Adjusted Balance if applicable) by the\ndue date each month. We will charge you interest on cash advances and\n(unless otherwise disclosed) balance transfers beginning on the transaction\ndate.\n\nForeign Currency Charges: If you make a Charge in a foreign currency, we\nwill convert it into US dollars on the date we or our agents process it. We\nwill charge a fee of 2.70% of the converted US dollar amount. We will\nchoose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date, unless a\nparticular rate is required by law. The conversion rate we use is no more\nthan the highest official rate published by a government agency or the\nhighest interbank rate we identify from customary banking sources on the\nconversion date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates in\neffect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments\n(such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such establishments use.\n\nChange of Address, phone number, email\n\n- Online at www.americanexpress.com/updatecontactinfo\n- Via mobile device\n- Voice automated: call the number on the back of your card\n\n- For name, company name, and foreign address or phone changes, please call Customer Care\n\nPlease do not add any written communication or address change on this stub\n\nCredit Balance: A credit balance (designated CR) shown on this statement\nrepresents money owed to you. If within the six-month period following\nthe date of the first statement indicating the credit balance you do not\nrequest a refund or charge enough to use up the credit balance, we will\nsend you a check for the credit balance within 30 days if the amount is\n$1.00 or more.\n\nCredit Reporting: We may report information about your Account to credit\nbureaus.

This is called\n\"trailing interest\". Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that\nhappens, we charge interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest\non purchases by paying your balance in full (or if you have a Plan balance, by paying your Adjusted Balance on your billing statement) by\nthe due date each month. Please see the \"When we charge interest\" sub-section in your Cardmember Agreement for details.\n\n \n\n2023 Fees and Interest Totals Year-to-Date\n\nAmount\nTotal Fees in 2023 $0.00\n\nTotal Interest in 2023 $0.00\n\n \n\nInterest Charge Calculation Days in Billing Period: 28\n\nYour Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the annual interest rate on your account.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTransactions Dated Annual Balance Interest\nPercentage Subject to Charge\n\nFrom To Rate Interest Rate\nPurchases 08/31/2021 26.49% (v) $0.00 $0.00\nCash Advances 08/14/2017 29.74% (v) $0.00 $0.00\nTotal $0.00\n\n \n\n(v) Variable Rate\n\fVICTOR A MIRON Account Ending 3-34001 p.8/9\n\fp.9/9\n\u2014 VICTOR A MIRON Closing Date 02/08/23 Account Ending 3-34001\nIMPORTANT NOTICES\n\nEFT Error Resolution Notice\nIn Case of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers Telephone us at 1-800-IPAY-AXP for Pay By\nPhone questions, at 1-800-528-2122 for Pay By Computer questions, and at 1-800-528-4800 for AutoPay.
