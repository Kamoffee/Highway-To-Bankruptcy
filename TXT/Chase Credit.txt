We reserve all\nour rights regarding these payments (e.g, if it is determined there is no valid dispute\nor if any such check is received at any other address, we may accept the check and\nyou will still owe any remaining balance). We may refuse to accept any such payment\nby returning it to you, not cashing it or destroying it.

We will add your annual\nmembership fee to your monthly billing statement once a year, whether or not you use\nyour account. Your annual membership fee will be added to your purchase balance\nand may incur interest. The annual membership fee is non-refundable unless you\nnotify us that you wish to close your account within 30 days or one billing cycle\n(whichever is less) after we provide the statement on which the annual membership\nfee is billed.

For an explanation of either method, or\nquestions about a particular interest charge calculation on your statement, please call\nus at the toll free customer service phone number listed above.\n\nWe calculate periodic interest charges separately for each feature (for example,\npurchases, balance transfers, cash advances or overdraft advances). These\ncalculations may combine different categories with the same periodic rates.

There is a transaction fee for each balance transfer, cash\nadvance, or check transaction in the amount stated in your Account Agreement. There\nis a foreign transaction fee of 3% of the U.S. dollar amount of any foreign transaction\nfor some accounts. Please see your Account Agreement for information about these\nfees,\n\nInterest Accrual: We accrue periodic interest charges on a transaction, fee or interest\ncharge from the date it is added to your daily balance until payment in full is received\non your account.\n\nCredit Limit: If you want to inquire about your options to help prevent your account\nfrom exceeding your credit limit, please call the number on the back of your card.\n\nPayment Allocation: When you make a payment, generally, we first apply your\nminimum payment to the balance on your monthly statement with the lowest APR.\nAny payment above your minimum payment would generally then be applied to the\nbalance on your monthly statement with the highest APR first, If you do not pay your\nbalance in full each month, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new\npurchases.\n\nDA05042021\n\nTo manage your account, including card payments, alerts, and change of address, visit\nwww.chase.com/cardhelp or call the customer service number which appears on your\n\naccount statement.\n\nL\n\n4\n\n \n\f \n\n1-800-346-5538 Chase Mobile\u00ae app today\n\nManage your account online at:\n\u201coy B www.chase.convcardhelp\n\nYOUR ACCOUNT MESSAGES (CONTINUED)\n\nstatement is less than the Fixed Amount or if the Current Balance when AutoPay processes is less than the Fixed\nAmount.\n\nCustomer Service: B Mobile: Download the\n\nACCOUNT ACTIVITY\n\nDate of\nTransaction Merchant Name or Transaction Description $ Amount\n04/11 Payment Thank You-Mobile -1,587.33\n04/16 Payment Thank You-Mobile -59.95\n04/14 TVC PRO-DRIVER 800-288-2889 OK 59.95\n04/17 PURCHASE INTEREST CHARGE 18.42\n\nVICTOR A MIRON\nTRANSACTIONS THIS CYCLE (CARD 0793) $1568.91-\nINCLUDING PAYMENTS RECEIVED\n\n \n\n2022 Totals Year-to-Date\n\nTotal fees charged in 2022 $0.00\nTotal interest charged in 2022 $64.02\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYear-to-date totals do not reflect any fee or interest refunds\nyou may have received.\n\nINTEREST CHARGES\n\nYour Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the annual interest rate on your account.\n\nAnnual Balance\nBalance Type Percentage Subject To Interest\nRate (APR) Interest Rate Charges\n\nPURCHASES\n\nPurchases 17.49%(v)(d) $1,239.85 $18.42\nCASH ADVANCES\n\nCash Advances 25.24%(v)(d) -0- -0-\nBALANCE TRANSFERS\n\nBalance Transfer 17.49%(v)(d) -0- -0-\n\n31 Days in Billing Period\n(v) = Variable Rate\n(d) = Daily Balance Method (including new transactions)\n(a) = Average Daily Balance Method (including new transactions)\nPlease see Information About Your Account section for the Calculation of Balance Subject to Interest Rate, Annual Renewal Notice,\nHow to Avoid Interest on Purchases, and other important information, as applicable.\n\nIMPORTANT NEWS\nYour account is a business account,\nto be used only for business transactions.\nIt is not intended for personal, family\nor household purposes.\nVICTOR A MIRON This Statement is a Fatsnntl\u00e9 - Not an original \u2014_ Statement Date: 04/17/22\n\n0000001 FIS33339 C 1 N Z 17 22/04/17 Page 2 of 2 00225 + MADA 45803 10710000010004580302\n\f\f"
