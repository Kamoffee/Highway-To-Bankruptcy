You can\npay down balances faster by paying more than the minimum payment or the total\nunpaid balance on your account.\n\nYou may make payments electronically through our website or by one of our customer\nservice phone numbers above. In using any of these channels, you are authorizing us\nto withdraw funds as a one-time electronic funds transfer from your bank account. In\n\u2018our automated phone system, this authorization is provided via entry of a personal\nidentification number. You may revoke this authorization by cancelling your payment\nthrough our website or customer service telephone numbers prior to the payment\nprocessing. If we receive your completed payment request through one of these\nchannels by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, we will credit your payment as of that day. If\nwe receive your request after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, we will credit your payment\nas of the next calendar day. If you specify a future date in your request we will credit\nyour payment as of that day.\n\nIf you pay by regular U.S, mail to the Payrnents address shown on this statement,\nwrite your account number on your check or money order and include the payment\ncoupon in the envelope. Do not send more than one payment or coupon per envelope\nDo not staple, clip or tape the documents. Do not include correspondence. Do not\nsend cash. If we receive your properly prepared payment on any day by 5 p.m. local\ntime at our Payments address on this statement, we will credit to your account that\nday. If your payment is received after 5 p.m. local time at our Payments address on\nthis statement, we will credit it to your account as of the next calendar day.\n\nFor all other payments or for any payment type above for which you do not follow our\npayment instructions, crediting of your payments may be delayed for up to 5 days.\n\nAccount Information Reported To Credit Bureau: We may report information about\nyour Account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments or other defaults\n\u2018on your Account may be reflected in your credit report. If you think we have reported\ninaccurate information to a credit bureau, please write to us at Chase Card Services\nP.O, Box 15369, Wilmington, DE 19850-5369,\n\nTo Service And Manage Any Of Your Account(s): By providing my mobile phone\nnumber, | am giving permission to be contacted at that number about all of my\naccounts by JPMorgan Chase and companies working on its behalf. My consent\nallows the use of text messages, artificial or prerecorded voice messages and\nautomatic dialing technology for informational and account servicing, but not for sales\nor telemarketing. Message and data rates may apply.\n\nAuthorization To Convert Your Check To An Electronic Transfer Debit: When you\nprovide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your\ncheck to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process\nthe payment as a check. Your bank account may be debited as soon as the same day\nwe receive your payment. You will not receive your check back from your institution.\n\nConditional Payments: Any payment check or other form of payment that you send\n\nus for less than the full balance due that is marked \u201cpaid in full\u201d or contains a similar\nnotation, or that you otherwise tender in full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must\nbe sent to Card Services, P.O. Box 15049, Wilmington, DE 19850-5049. We reserve all\nour rights regarding these payments (e.g, if it is determined there is no valid dispute\nor if any such check is received at any other address, we may accept the check and\nyou will still owe any remaining balance). We may refuse to accept any such payment\nby returning it to you, not cashing it or destroying it. All other payments that you make\nshould be sent to the regular Payment address shown on this statement.\n\nAnnual Renewal Notice: If your Account Agreement has an annual membership fee,\nyou are responsible for it every year your Account is open. We will add your annual\nmembership fee to your monthly billing statement once a year, whether or not you use\nyour account. Your annual membership fee will be added to your purchase balance\nand may incur interest. The annual membership fee is non-refundable unless you\nnotify us that you wish to close your account within 30 days or one billing cycle\n(whichever is less) after we provide the statement on which the annual membership\nfee is billed. Your payment of the annual membership fee does not affect our rights\nto close your Account and to limit your right to make transactions on your Account.\nIf your Account is closed by you or us, the annual membership fee will no longer be\nbilled to your Account.\n\nCalculation Of Balance Subject To Interest Rate: To figure your periodic interest\ncharges for each billing cycle when a daily periodic rate(s) applies, we use the daily\nbalance method (including new transactions). To figure your periodic interest charges\nfor each billing cycle when a monthly periodic rate(s) applies, we use the average daily\nbalance method (including new transactions). For an explanation of either method, or\nquestions about a particular interest charge calculation on your statement, please call\nus at the toll free customer service phone number listed above.\n\nWe calculate periodic interest charges separately for each feature (for example,\npurchases, balance transfers, cash advances or overdraft advances). These\ncalculations may combine different categories with the same periodic rates. Variable\nrates will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate or such index described in\nyour Account Agreement. There is a transaction fee for each balance transfer, cash\nadvance, or check transaction in the amount stated in your Account Agreement. There\nis a foreign transaction fee of 3% of the U.S. dollar amount of any foreign transaction\nfor some accounts. Please see your Account Agreement for information about these\nfees,\n\nInterest Accrual: We accrue periodic interest charges on a transaction, fee or interest\ncharge from the date it is added to your daily balance until payment in full is received\non your account.\n\nCredit Limit: If you want to inquire about your options to help prevent your account\nfrom exceeding your credit limit, please call the number on the back of your card.\n\nPayment Allocation: When you make a payment, generally, we first apply your\nminimum payment to the balance on your monthly statement with the lowest APR.\nAny payment above your minimum payment would generally then be applied to the\nbalance on your monthly statement with the highest APR first, If you do not pay your\nbalance in full each month, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new\npurchases.\n\nDA05042021\n\nTo manage your account, including card payments, alerts, and change of address, visit\nwww.chase.com/cardhelp or call the customer service number which appears on your\n\naccount statement.\n\nL\n\n4\n\n \n\fManage your account online at:\n\u201coy B www.chase.convcardhelp\n\nCustomer Service:\n1-800-346-5538\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMobile: Download the\nChase Mobile\u00ae app today\n\nDate of\nTransaction Merchant Name or Transaction Description $ Amount\n01/21 Payment Thank You-Mobile -274.49\n01/25 Payment Thank You-Mobile -173.53\n02/11 Payment Thank You-Mobile -216.99\n01/20 KYTC MOTOR CARRIERS EGOV.COM KY 173.53\n02/06 CITYOFSTLOUIS-PARKING 314-622-4700 MO 2.45\n02/09 TMOBILE*AUTO PAY 800-937-8997 WA 214.54\n02/14 TVC PRO-DRIVER 800-288-2889 OK 59.95\nVICTOR A MIRON\nTRANSACTIONS THIS CYCLE (CARD 0793) $214.54-\nINCLUDING PAYMENTS RECEIVED\n2023 Totals Year-to-Date\nTotal fees charged in 2023 $0.00\nTotal interest charged in 2023 $0.00\nYear-to-date totals do not reflect any fee or interest refunds\nyou may have received.\nYour Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the annual interest rate on your account.\nAnnual Balance\nBalance Type Percentage Subject To Interest\nRate (APR) Interest Rate Charges\nPURCHASES\nPurchases 21.74%(v)(d) -0- -0-\nCASH ADVANCES\nCash Advances 29.49%(v)(d) -0- -0-\nBALANCE TRANSFERS\nBalance Transfer 21.74%(v)(d) -0- -0-\n\n(v) = Variable Rate\n(\n\nd) = Daily Balance Method (including new transactions)\n\n(a) =\n\nAverage Daily Balance Method (including new transactions)\n\n31 Days in Billing Period\n\nPlease see Information About Your Account section for the Calculation of Balance Subject to Interest Rate, Annual Renewal Notice,\nHow to Avoid Interest on Purchases, and other important information, as applicable.\n\nVICTOR A MIRON\n0000001\n\nFIS33339 C 1\n\nPage 2 of 2\nY 9 17 23/02/17 Page 2 of 2 00225 MADA 18383\n\nStatement Date: 02/17/23\n04810000010001838302\n\f\f"
