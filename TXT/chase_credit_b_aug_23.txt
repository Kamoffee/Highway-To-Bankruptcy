We will add your annual\nmembership fee to your monthly billing statement once a year, whether or not you use\nyour account. Your annual membership fee will be added to your purchase balance\nand may incur interest. The annual membership fee is non-refundable unless you\nnotify us that you wish to close your account within 30 days or one billing cycle\n(whichever is less) after we provide the statement on which the annual membership\nfee is billed. Your payment of the annual membership fee does not affect our rights\nto close your Account and to limit your right to make transactions on your Account.\nIf your Account is closed by you or us, the annual membership fee will no longer be\nbilled to your Account.\n\nCalculation Of Balance Subject To Interest Rate: To figure your periodic interest\ncharges for each billing cycle when a daily periodic rate(s) applies, we use the daily\nbalance method (including new transactions). To figure your periodic interest charges\nfor each billing cycle when a monthly periodic rate(s) applies, we use the average daily\nbalance method (including new transactions). For an explanation of either method, or\nquestions about a particular interest charge calculation on your statement, please call\nus at the toll free customer service phone number listed above.\n\nWe calculate periodic interest charges separately for each feature (for example,\npurchases, balance transfers, cash advances or overdraft advances). These\ncalculations may combine different categories with the same periodic rates. Variable\nrates will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate or such index described in\nyour Account Agreement. There is a transaction fee for each balance transfer, cash\nadvance, or check transaction in the amount stated in your Account Agreement. There\nis a foreign transaction fee of 3% of the U.S. dollar amount of any foreign transaction\nfor some accounts. Please see your Account Agreement for information about these\nfees,\n\nInterest Accrual: We accrue periodic interest charges on a transaction, fee or interest\ncharge from the date it is added to your daily balance until payment in full is received\non your account.\n\nCredit Limit: If you want to inquire about your options to help prevent your account\nfrom exceeding your credit limit, please call the number on the back of your card.\n\nPayment Allocation: When you make a payment, generally, we first apply your\nminimum payment to the balance on your monthly statement with the lowest APR.\nAny payment above your minimum payment would generally then be applied to the\nbalance on your monthly statement with the highest APR first, If you do not pay your\nbalance in full each month, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new\npurchases.\n\nDA05042021\n\nTo manage your account, including card payments, alerts, and change of address, visit\nwww.chase.com/cardhelp or call the customer service number which appears on your\n\naccount statement.\n\nL\n\n4\n\n \n\f \n\nManage your account online at:\n\u201coy B www.chase.convcardhelp\n\nYOUR ACCOUNT MESSAGES (CONTINUED)\n\n1-800-346-5538\n\nChase Mobile\u00ae app today\n\nCustomer Service: B Mobile: Download the\n\nstatement is less than the Fixed Amount or if the Current Balance when AutoPay processes is less than the Fixed\n\nAmount.\n\nACCOUNT ACTIVITY\n\nDate of\nTransaction Merchant Name or Transaction Description\n08/11 AUTOMATIC PAYMENT - THANK YOU\n08/14 TVC PRO-DRIVER clover.com OK\n08/17 PURCHASE INTEREST CHARGE\n\nVICTOR A MIRON\nTRANSACTIONS THIS CYCLE (CARD 0793) $17.37\nINCLUDING PAYMENTS RECEIVED\n\n \n\n2023 Totals Year-to-Date\n\nTotal fees charged in 2023 $0.00\nTotal interest charged in 2023 $248.71\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYear-to-date totals do not reflect any fee or interest refunds\nyou may have received.\n\nINTEREST CHARGES\n\nYour Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the annual interest rate on your account.\n\nAnnual Balance\nBalance Type Percentage Subject To\nRate (APR) Interest Rate\n\nPURCHASES\n\nPurchases 22.49%(v) (d) $3,006.06\nCASH ADVANCES\n\nCash Advances 29.99%(v)(d) -0-\nBALANCE TRANSFERS\n\nBalance Transfers 22.49%(v)(d) -0-\n\n(v) = Variable Rate\n(d) = Daily Balance Method (including new transactions)\n(a) = Average Daily Balance Method (including new transactions)\n\n$ Amount\n-100.00\n\n59.95\n57.42\n\nInterest\nCharges\n\n$57.42\n\n-0-\n\n-0-\n31 Days in Billing Period\n\nPlease see Information About Your Account section for the Calculation of Balance Subject to Interest Rate, Annual Renewal Notice, How\n\nto Avoid Interest on Purchases, and other important information, as applicable.\n\nVICTOR A MIRON Page 2 of 2\n0000001 FIS33339.C 1 Y 9 17 23/08/17 Page 2 of 2 00225 MADA 36599 \u2014-22910000010003659902\n\nStatement Date: 08/17/23\n\f\f"
