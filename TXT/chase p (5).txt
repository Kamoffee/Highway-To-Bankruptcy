During our\nnightly processing, we take your previous end of day\u2019s balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available\nfor use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we\nsubtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day\nmay not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly\nprocessing.\n\nWe pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions\npresented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft,\nyour transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the\nDeposit Account Agreement.\n\nWe can cover your overdrafts in three different ways:\n1. We have Standard Overdraft Practices that come with your account.\n2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our\nStandard Overdraft Practices. You can contact us to learn more.\n3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage, which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card\ntransactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practices.\n\nThis notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage.\n\u00a2 What are the Standard Overdraft Practices that come with my account?\n\nWe do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions:\n\ne Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number\n\ne Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships)\n\n\u00ab What is Chase Debit Card Coverage?\n\nIf you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we will authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card\n\ntransactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice.\n\n\u00a2 What fees will | be charged if Chase pays my overdraft?\n\nIf we authorize and pay an overdraft, we'll charge you a $34 Insufficient Funds Fee per transaction during our\n\nnightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50\n\n(maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102).\n\nWe won't charge you an Insufficient Funds Fee in the following circumstances:\n\ne With Chase Overdraft AssistS\u201c, we won't charge an Insufficient Funds Fee if you\u2019re overdrawn by $50 or less at\nthe end of the business day OR if you\u2019re overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to\noverdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a\ndeposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase\nchecking accounts.\n\nWe won't charge an Insufficient Funds Fee for transactions that are $5 or less.\nWe won't charge an Insufficient Funds Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a\nsufficient available balance in your account.\n\n\u00a2 For Chase SapphireS\u201c Checking and Chase Private Client CheckingS\u201d accounts, there are no Insufficient\nFunds Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business\ndays during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this\ncounts toward the four business days when an Insufficient Funds Fee will not be charged.\n\n\u00a2 What if | want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions?\n\nIf you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please\n\nmake your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. You can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at\n\nany time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile\u00ae to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935\n\n(or collect at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.
