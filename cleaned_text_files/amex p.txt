Payments we receive after 5 p.m. will not be credited to your Account until the next day. Payments must also: (1) include the remittance coupon from your statement; (2) be made with a single check drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a negotiable instrument payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system; and (3) include your Account number. If your payment does not meet all of the above requirements, crediting may be delayed and you may incur late payment fees and additional interest charges. Electronic payments must be made through an electronic payment method payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. Please do not send post-dated checks as they will be deposited upon receipt. Any restrictive language on a payment we accept will have no effect on us without our express prior written approval. We will re-present to your financial institution any payment that is returned unpaid. You may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due, up to your New Balance, at any time.  Permission for Electronic Withdrawal: (1) When you send a check for payment, you give us permission to electronically withdraw your payment from your deposit or other asset account. We will process checks electronically by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not processable electronically or a less costly process is available. When we process your check electronically, your payment may be withdrawn from your deposit or other asset account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your deposit or other asset account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically we may issue a draft against your deposit or other asset account for the amount of the check. (2) By using Pay By Computer, Pay By Phone or any other electronic payment service of ours, you give us permission to electronically withdraw funds from the deposit or other asset account you specify in the amount you request. Payments using such services of ours received after 8:00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the next day.  How We Calculate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance (ADB) method (including new transactions) to calculate the balance on which we charge interest on your Account. Call the Customer Care number on page 3 for more information about this balance computation method and how resulting interest charges are determined. The method we use to figure the ADB and interest results in daily compounding of interest.  Paying Interest: Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. We will not charge you interest on your purchases if you pay each month your entire balance (or Adjusted Balance if applicable) by the due date each month. We will charge you interest on cash advances and (unless otherwise disclosed) balance transfers beginning on the transaction date.  Foreign Currency Charges: If you make a Charge in a foreign currency, we will convert it into US dollars on the date we or our agents process it. We will charge a fee of 2.70% of the converted US dollar amount. We will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date, unless a particular rate is required by law. The conversion rate we use is no more than the highest official rate published by a government agency or the highest interbank rate we identify from customary banking sources on the conversion date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such establishments use.

If within the six-month period following the date of the first statement indicating the credit balance you do not request a refund or charge enough to use up the credit balance, we will send you a check for the credit balance within 30 days if the amount is $1.00 or more.  Credit Reporting: We may report information about your Account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Account may be reflected in your credit report.  What To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement  If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:  American Express, PO Box 981535, El Paso TX 79998-1535  You may also contact us on the Web: www.americanexpress.com  In your letter, give us the following information:  - Account information: Your name and account number.  - Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.  - Description of Problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.  You must contact us within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.  You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.  While we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following are true:  - We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.  - The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. But, if we determine that we made a mistake, you will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.  - While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.  - We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.  Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases  If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.  To use this right, all of the following must be true:  1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these is necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)  2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.  3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.  If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at:  American Express, PO Box 981535, El Paso TX 79998-1535 www.americanexpress.com  While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay we may report you as delinquent.

You'll receive $7 in statement credits monthly (up to $84 back annually) after spending $13.99 or more each month on an eligible subscription to The Disney Bundle, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN, using your Blue Cash Everyday Card. Enrollment required.  Terms and Conditions. Enrollment on the Amex.com Benefit Dashboard is required to receive this benefit. Blue Cash Everyday Card Members are eligible to receive a $7 statement credit each month after making qualifying purchases online at U.S. websites Disneyplus.com, Hulu.com or Plus.espn.com and in U.S. dollars amounting $13.99 (excluding taxes) or more in that calendar month.  "Qualifying purchases " include The Disney Bundle monthly subscription purchases of either $13.99 a month or $19.99 a month (excluding taxes) and any other monthly or annual subscription purchase or add-ons purchased at U.S. websites Disneyplus.com, Hulu.com or Plus.espn.com that amount to $13.99 (excluding taxes) or more in any one calendar month made with your enrolled Card. If you purchase a monthly subscription, unless you notify the merchant that you want to cancel, your subscription will automatically renew for another monthly subscription period (subject to applicable law). This means that the merchant will collect the then-applicable subscription fee and any taxes by charging a credit card the merchant has on record for you without notifying you unless notification is required by applicable law. Your purchase will not qualify if you purchase your subscription through a third-party device or digital platform (unless the device or platform redirects to Disneyplus.com, Hulu.com or Plus.espn.com for purchase), or as a bundle with cable services or as another bundle. If you upgrade an already existing Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+ subscription to The Disney Bundle monthly subscription in the middle of a subscription month, your first month's subscription purchase will be pro-rated and may be less than $13.99 and therefore may not qualify for a statement credit that month. Further, if you change an already existing Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+ annual subscription to The Disney Bundle and your ongoing monthly charge is less than $13.99, you may not qualify for a statement credit. A single purchase of an annual subscription on an enrolled account also qualifies for a $7 statement credit, but you would only be eligible for a one-time $7 statement credit in the month of this purchase. Must be 18+ to subscribe to Disney+ or The Disney Bundle. The Disney Bundle is only available in the 50 United States, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The Disney Bundle is not available in any other U.S. territories. Once you enroll your Card in this benefit, you must spend a minimum of $13.99 in one or more qualifying U.S. purchases by the last day of each calendar month to be considered eligible for a statement credit in that month. You may receive the monthly statement credit each month starting from the month you enroll. Your ability to earn a statement credit will reset on the first day of each calendar month and end on the last day of the same calendar month. Qualifying purchases must be charged to the enrolled Card Account for the benefit to apply. Purchases by both the enrolled Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on the enrolled Card Account are eligible for statement credits. However, each Card Account is only eligible for one $7 statement credit per month.  Please allow 6-8 weeks after a qualifying purchase is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the Account. Please call the number on the back of the Card if statement credits have not posted after 8 weeks from the date of purchase. American Express relies on the merchant to process transactions within the same calendar month that you made the purchase in order to apply the $7 monthly statement credit in the month that it was intended. For example, if you make an eligible purchase on the last day of the month, but the merchant doesn't process that transaction until the next day, then the statement credit would be applied in the following month. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible for this benefit, you will not receive the statement credit. To be eligible for this benefit, Card Account must not be canceled and not past due at the time of statement credit fulfillment. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account, the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead, the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance. For additional information, call the number on the back of your Card.  Effective July 14, 2022, the $180 Home Chef Credit will be a new benefit available on your Card.  You'll receive up to $15 in statement credits monthly for online purchases at Home Chef on your Blue Cash Everyday Card. That's up to $180 in statement credits annually. Enrollment required. Shipping available in the contiguous US only.  Terms and Conditions. You can receive up to $15 in monthly statement credits when you use your Blue Cash Everyday Card to pay for online Home Chef purchases (up to $180 per year). Enrollment on the Amex.com Benefit Dashboard is required to receive this benefit. Eligible purchases must be made online at HomeChef.com and must be charged to the enrolled Card Account for the benefit to apply. Home Chef meal solutions are available to purchase and ship in the 48 contiguous United States and Washington, D.C. Purchases by both the enrolled Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on the enrolled Card Account are eligible for statement credits. However, each Card Account is eligible for a maximum of $15 in statement credits per month, for a total of $180 per calendar year in statement credits across all Cards on the Card Account.  Please allow 6-8 weeks after an eligible purchase is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the Card Account. Please call the number on the back of the Card if statement credits have not posted after 8 weeks from the date of purchase. American Express relies on the merchant to process transactions within the same calendar month that you made the purchase in order to apply the $15 monthly statement credit in the month that it was intended.
