If you pay your New Balance in full by the due date each month, we will not charge interest on new transactions that post to the purchase balance. If you have been paying in full without Interest Charges, but fail to pay your next New Balance in full, we will charge interest on the unpaid balance. Interest Charges on Cash Advances and Special Transfers start on the transaction date. Promotional offers may allow you to pay less than the total New Balance and avoid paying interest on new transactions that post to your purchase balance. See the front of your statement for additional information.  How is the Interest Charge Determined? Interest Charges accrue from the date of the transaction, date the transaction is processed or the first day of the Billing Cycle. Interest accrues daily on every unpaid amount until it is paid in full. Interest accrued during a Billing Cycle posts to your account at the end of the Billing cycle and appears on your next statement. You may owe Interest Charges even if you pay the entire New Balance one month, but did not do so the prior month. Once you start accruing Interest Charges, you generally must pay your New Balance in full two consecutive Billing Cycles before Interest Charges stop being posted to your Statement. Interest Charges are added to the corresponding segment of your account.  Do you assess a Minimum Interest Charge? We may assess a minimum Interest Charge of $0.00 for each Billing Cycle if your account is subject to an Interest Charge.  How do you Calculate the Interest Charge? We use a method called Average Daily Balance (including new transactions).  1. First, for each segment we take the beginning balance each day and add in new transactions and the periodic Interest Charge on the previous day's balance. Then we subtract any payments and credits for that segment as of that day. The result is the daily balance for each segment. However, if your previous statement balance was zero or a credit amount, new transactions which post to your purchase segment are not added to the daily balance.  2. Next, for each segment, we add the daily balances together and divide the sum by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. The result is the Average Daily Balance for each segment.  3. At the end of each Billing Cycle, we multiply your Average Daily Balance for each segment by the daily periodic rate (APR divided by 365) for that segment, and then we multiply the result by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. We add the Interest Charges for all segments together. The result is your total Interest Charge for the Billing Cycle.  The Average Daily Balance is referred to as the Balance Subject to Interest Rate in the Interest Charge Calculation section of this Statement.  NOTE: Due to rounding or a minimum Interest Charge, this calculation may vary slightly from the Interest Charge actually assessed.  How can | Avoid Membership Fees? If a Renewal Notice is printed on this statement, you may avoid paying an annual membership Fee by contacting Customer Service no later than 45 days after the last day in the Billing Cycle covered by this statement to request that we close your account. To avoid paying a monthly membership Fee, close your account and we will stop assessing your monthly membership Fee.  How can | Close My Account? You can contact Customer Service anytime to request that we close your account.

You can change your address by signing into your account online or by calling Customer Service.  Any written request on this form will not be honored.  How do you Process Payments? When you make a payment, you authorize us to initiate an  ACH or electronic payment that will be debited from your bank account or other related  account. When you provide a check or check information to make a payment, you authorize us to use information from the check to make a one-time ACH or other electronic transfer from  your bank account. We may also process it as a check transaction. Funds may be withdrawn  from your bank account as soon as the same day we process your payment.  How do you Apply My Payment? We generally apply payments up to your Minimum Payment first to the balance with the lowest APR (including 0% APR), and then to balances with higher APRs. We apply any part of your payment exceeding your Minimum Payment to the balance with the highest APR, and then to balances with lower APRs.
