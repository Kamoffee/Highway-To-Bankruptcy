Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of day u2019s balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing.  We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in  the Deposit Account Agreement.  We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have a Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practice. You can contact us to learn more. 8. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage u00ae, which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice.  This notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage.   u00a2 What is the Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with my account? We do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions:  u2014 Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number  u2014 Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships)   u00ab What is Chase Debit Card Coverage? If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we may authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice.   u00a2 What fees will | be charged if Chase pays my overdraft? If we authorize and pay an overdraft, we'll charge you a $34 Overdraft Fee (may also be referred to as Insufficient Funds Fee) per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102).  We won't charge you an Overdraft Fee in the following circumstances:   u2014 With Chase Overdraft Assist u201c, we won't charge an Overdraft Fee if you u2019re overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if you're overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase checking accounts.   u2014 We won't charge an Overdraft Fee for transactions that are $5 or less.   u2014 We won't charge an Overdraft Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a sufficient available balance in your account.   u2014 For Chase Sapphire u201d Checking and Chase Private Client Checking u2122 accounts, there are no Overdraft Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this counts toward the four business days when an Overdraft Fee will not be charged.   u00a2 What if | want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions? If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. You can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile u00ae to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 (or at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.
