You must contact us:  - Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.  - By 5:00 P.M. ET on the date an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing or electronically. You may call us, but if you do we are not necessarily required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.  What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter or Web Submission  When we receive your written or electronic notice, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your notice, we must tell you that we received it. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your notice, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.  While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:  - We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.  - The charge in question may continue to appear on your statement.  - While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. - We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.  After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:  - Ifwe made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.  if we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.     If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us (or visit https://discover.com/billingerrornotice) within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.  If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct. Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases  If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.  To use this right, all of the following must be true:  1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)  2. You must have used your credit card forthe purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.  If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at: Discover  P.O. Box 30945  Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0945  https://discover.com/billingerrornotice  While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.  Your next automatic minimum payment of $35.00 will be on April 2, 2023. Any payments made prior to this date will be applied towards your minimum payment due. Any credits applied to your Account for the billing cycle reflected on this statement may lower your minimum payment due and thus the scheduled DirectPay amount.
