Member FDIC     Page 4 of 6  fCHASE  u00a7  October 19, 2022 through November 16, 2022 Primary Account: 000000697827678  Overdraft and Overdraft Fee Information for Your Chase Checking Account  What You Need to Know About Overdrafts and Overdraft Fees  An overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway. Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of day u2019s balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing.  We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the Deposit Account Agreement.  We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have Standard Overdraft Practices that come with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practices. You can contact us to learn more. 3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage, which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practices.  This notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage.  u00a2 What are the Standard Overdraft Practices that come with my account?  We do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions:  e Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number  e Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships)   u00ab What is Chase Debit Card Coverage?  If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we will authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card  transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice.   u00a2 What fees will | be charged if Chase pays my overdraft?  If we authorize and pay an overdraft, we'll charge you a $34 Insufficient Funds Fee per transaction during our  nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50  (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102).  We won't charge you an Insufficient Funds Fee in the following circumstances:  e With Chase Overdraft AssistS u201c, we won't charge an Insufficient Funds Fee if you u2019re overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if you u2019re overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase checking accounts.  We won't charge an Insufficient Funds Fee for transactions that are $5 or less. We won't charge an Insufficient Funds Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a sufficient available balance in your account.   u00a2 For Chase SapphireS u201c Checking and Chase Private Client CheckingS u201d accounts, there are no Insufficient Funds Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this counts toward the four business days when an Insufficient Funds Fee will not be charged.   u00a2 What if | want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions?  If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please  make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. You can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at  any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile u00ae to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935  (or collect at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.
