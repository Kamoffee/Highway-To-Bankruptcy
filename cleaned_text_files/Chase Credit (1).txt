All other payments that you make should be sent to the regular Payment address shown on this statement.  Annual Renewal Notice: If your Account Agreement has an annual membership fee, you are responsible for it every year your Account is open. We will add your annual membership fee to your monthly billing statement once a year, whether or not you use your account. Your annual membership fee will be added to your purchase balance and may incur interest. The annual membership fee is non-refundable unless you notify us that you wish to close your account within 30 days or one billing cycle (whichever is less) after we provide the statement on which the annual membership fee is billed. Your payment of the annual membership fee does not affect our rights to close your Account and to limit your right to make transactions on your Account. If your Account is closed by you or us, the annual membership fee will no longer be billed to your Account.  Calculation Of Balance Subject To Interest Rate: To figure your periodic interest charges for each billing cycle when a daily periodic rate(s) applies, we use the daily balance method (including new transactions). To figure your periodic interest charges for each billing cycle when a monthly periodic rate(s) applies, we use the average daily balance method (including new transactions). For an explanation of either method, or questions about a particular interest charge calculation on your statement, please call us at the toll free customer service phone number listed above.  We calculate periodic interest charges separately for each feature (for example, purchases, balance transfers, cash advances or overdraft advances). These calculations may combine different categories with the same periodic rates. Variable rates will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate or such index described in your Account Agreement. There is a transaction fee for each balance transfer, cash advance, or check transaction in the amount stated in your Account Agreement. There is a foreign transaction fee of 3% of the U.S. dollar amount of any foreign transaction for some accounts. Please see your Account Agreement for information about these fees,  Interest Accrual: We accrue periodic interest charges on a transaction, fee or interest charge from the date it is added to your daily balance until payment in full is received on your account.  Credit Limit: If you want to inquire about your options to help prevent your account from exceeding your credit limit, please call the number on the back of your card.  Payment Allocation: When you make a payment, generally, we first apply your minimum payment to the balance on your monthly statement with the lowest APR. Any payment above your minimum payment would generally then be applied to the balance on your monthly statement with the highest APR first, If you do not pay your balance in full each month, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new purchases.
