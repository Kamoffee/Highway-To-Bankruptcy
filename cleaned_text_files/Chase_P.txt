Here u2019s what you need to know.  These changes may affect your currently scheduled Autosave transfers and the Chase Savings u00ae u201d account monthly service fee waiver.  Beginning February 1, 2024:  e Existing safety net and custom goals will be discontinued. You'll need to set up these transfers again as general savings goals.  e Daily account transfers will be discontinued, but we have other scheduling options to help support your savings goals, including transfers as often as every week or when you receive a deposit.  e If you have paused a general transfer goal that was supposed to occur on a schedule, it will be discontinued.  e u00a2 You'll no longer be able to pause transfers that are set up to your savings account on a recurring basis. You can still pause your scheduled transfers that occur when you receive a deposit. You can still cancel your transfer at any time.   u00a2 There will no longer be an option to pause a transfer if your checking balance drops below a specified amount. To help prevent an overdraft from happening from an Autosave transfer, we'll skip your transfer if you don u2019t have enough money in your checking account or linked Overdraft Protection backup account. Please remember, you may have other transactions that could still cause an overdraft if you don u2019t have enough money in your account.  e Transfers from a Chase checking account to an investment account will now be viewable and managed through Pay & Transfer instead of Autosave. If you have transfers to an investment account set up daily or when you get a deposit, those will end.  If you have a goal or transfer affected by these changes, here u2019s what you can do before February 1, 2024: e If you have a daily transfer, custom goal or safety net goal, you'll need to create a new general savings goal to your savings account. e  u2014 If you don u2019t create a new Autosave transfer by this date, your current transfers will be discontinued. You can always set up new Autosave transfers in the future.  Special note for Chase Savings u00ae u201d accounts that use Autosave to waive the $5 Monthly Service Fee: Please review your currently scheduled Autosave transfers and if needed, create a new repeating general savings goal of at least $25 per month so you can continue receiving the monthly service fee waiver benefit.  As a reminder, you can still waive the Chase Savings u00ae u201d Monthly Service Fee when you have any one of the following during each monthly statement period: e  Abalance at the beginning of each day of $300 or more in this account, or  u00a2 $25 or more in total Autosave or other repeating automatic transfers from your personal Chase checking account (available only through chase.com or Chase Mobile), or  u00a2 AChase College Checking u00ae u2122 account linked to this account for Overdraft Protection, or e  u2014 An account owner who is an individual younger than 18, or  u00a2  Alinked Chase Premier Plus Checking u2122, Chase Sapphire u201d Checking or Chase Private Client Checking u201d account  We're here to help you stay on track with your savings.
