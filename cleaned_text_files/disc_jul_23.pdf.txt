Gas Station purchases include those made at merchants classified as places that sell automotive gasoline that can be bought at the pump or inside the station, and public electric vehicle charging stations. Gas Stations affiliated with supermarkets, supercenters, and wholesale clubs may not be eligible.

Wallets that qualify include Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Garmin Pay and in store with Google Pay. Apple Pay transactions included in this offer are transactions made in-store or online when using the Apple Pay button. Listed merchants are in no way sponsoring or affiliated with this program. Certain third-party payment accounts and digital wallet transactions may not earn 5% if Discover does not receive sufficient transaction detail for the purchase to be identified as being through a digital wallet. Discover does not determine the transaction details it receives for purchases. Using digital wallets to make purchases at gas stations will only earn a total of 5%. Purchases must be made with merchants in the U.S. To qualify for 5%, the purchase transaction date must be before or on the last day of the offer or promotion. For online purchases, the transaction date from the merchant may be the date when the item ships. Rewards are added to your account within two billing periods. Even if a purchase appears to fit in a 5% category, the merchant may not have a merchant category code (MCC) in that category. Merchants and payment processors are assigned an MCC based on their typical products and services. Discover Card does not assign MCCs to merchants. Certain third-party payment accounts and digital wallet transactions may not earn 5% if the technology does not provide sufficient transaction details or a qualifying MCC.
