Conditional Payments: Any payment check or other form of payment that you send us for less than the full balance due that is marked  u201cpaid in full u201d or contains a similar notation, or that you otherwise tender in full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be sent to Card Services, P.O. Box 15049, Wilmington, DE 19850-5049. We reserve all our rights regarding these payments (e.g., if it is determined there is no valid dispute or if any such check is received at any other address, we may accept the check and you will still owe any remaining balance). We may refuse to accept any such payment by returning it to you, not cashing it or destroying it. All other payments that you make should be sent to the regular Payment address shown on this statement.  Annual Renewal Notice: If your Account Agreement has an annual membership fee, you are responsible for it every year your Account is open. We will add your annual membership fee to your monthly billing statement once a year, whether or not you use your account. Your annual membership fee will be added to your purchase balance and may incur interest, The annual membership fee is non-refundable unless you notify us that you wish to close your account within 30 days or one billing cycle (whichever is less) after we provide the statement on which the annual membership fee is billed. Your payment of the annual membership fee does not affect our rights to close your Account and to limit your right to make transactions on your Account. If your Account is closed by you or us, the annual membership fee will no longer be billed to your Account.  Calculation Of Balance Subject To Interest Rate: To figure your periodic interest charges for each billing cycle when a daily periodic rate(s) applies, we use the daily balance method (including new transactions). To figure your periodic interest charges for each billing cycle when a monthly periodic rate(s) applies, we use the average daily balance method (including new transactions). For an explanation of either method, or questions about a particular interest charge calculation on your statement, please call us at the toll free customer service phone number listed above.  We calculate periodic interest charges separately for each feature {for example, purchases, balance transfers, cash advances or overdraft advances). These calculations may combine different categories with the same periodic rates. Variable rates will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate or such index described in your Account Agreement. There is a transaction fee for each balance transfer,  cash advance, or check transaction in the amount stated in your Account Agreement. There is a foreign transaction fee of 3% of the U.S. dollar amount of any foreign transaction for some accounts, Please see your Account Agreement for information about these fees.  We add transactions and fees to your daily balance no earlier than:  1. the date of the transaction  u2014for new purchases, balance transfers, overdraft advances, cash advances, or My Chase Loans;  2. the date the payee deposits the check  u2014 for new cash advance checks or balance transfer checks,  3. the date of a related transaction, the date they are posted to your account, or the last day of the billing cycle, whichever we may choose  u2014 for fees  How To Avoid Paying Interest On Purchases: Your due date will be a minimum of 21 days after the close of each billing cycle. If you pay your account {or Interest Saving Balance) in full each billing period by the date and time due, no interest is charged  u2018on new purchases month to month. Also, we will not impose interest charges on any portion of a purchase balance you repay while that balance is subject to an interest- free period, Subject to any interest-free period for new purchases, we will begin charging interest from the date a transaction (including any balance transfer, cash advance or overdraft advance), fee or interest charge is added to your daily balance until your account is paid in full. Because we apply payments in excess of your minimum payment first to higher rate balances, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new purchases if you have another balance at a higher interest rate unless you pay your balance (or Interest Saving Balance) in full each month.
