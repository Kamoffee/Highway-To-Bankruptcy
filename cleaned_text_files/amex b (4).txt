Payments we receive after 5 p.m. will not be credited to your Account until the next day. Payments must also: (1) include the remittance coupon from your statement; (2) be made with a single check drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a negotiable instrument payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system; and (3) include your Account number. If your payment does not meet all of the above requirements, crediting may be delayed and you may incur late payment fees and additional interest charges. Electronic payments must be made through an electronic payment method payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. Please do not send post-dated checks as they will be deposited upon receipt. Any restrictive language on a payment we accept will have no effect on us without our express prior written approval. We will re-present to your financial institution any payment that is returned unpaid. You may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due, up to your New Balance, at any time.  Permission for Electronic Withdrawal: (1) When you send a check for payment, you give us permission to electronically withdraw your payment from your deposit or other asset account. We will process checks electronically by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not processable electronically or a less costly process is available. When we process your check electronically, your payment may be withdrawn from your deposit or other asset account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your financial account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically we may issue a draft against your deposit or other asset account for the amount of the check. (2) By using Pay By Computer, Pay By Phone or any other electronic payment service of ours, you give us permission to electronically withdraw funds from the deposit or other asset account you specify in the amount you request. Payments using such services of ours received after 8:00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the next day.  How We Calculate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance (ADB) method (including new transactions) to calculate the balance on which we charge interest on your Account. Call the Customer Care number on page 3 for more information about this balance computation method and how resulting interest charges are determined. The method we use to calculate the ADB and interest results in daily compounding of interest.  Paying Interest: Your due date is at least 25 days after the Closing Date of each billing period. We will not charge you interest on your purchases if you pay the New Balance by the due date each month. We will charge you interest on balance transfers (unless otherwise disclosed) beginning on the transaction date. You can avoid paying interest on the Amount Above the Credit Limit by paying your Minimum Payment Due before the closing date of the month in which it is due. See your Cardmember Agreement for further details.  Foreign Currency Charges: If you make a Charge in a foreign currency, we will convert it into US dollars on the date we or our agents process it. We will charge a fee of 2.70% of the converted US dollar amount.

The conversion rate we use is no more than the highest official rate published by a government agency or the highest interbank rate we identify from customary banking sources on the conversion date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such establishments use.  Credit Balance: A credit balance (designated CR) shown on this statement represents money owed to you. If within the six-month period following the date of the first statement indicating the credit balance you do not request a refund or charge enough to use up the credit balance, we will send you a check for the credit balance within 30 days if the amount is $1.00 or more.  Credit Reporting: We may report information about your Account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Account may be reflected in your credit report.

Reason(s) for Our Decision  We made this decision for the following reason(s): e Your APRs for purchases and balance transfers are lower than the APRs on the same or similar card products currently offered by American Express for Card Members with similar FICO scores. e Your FICO credit score as provided by Experian.  Information About Your FICO Score  We obtained your FICO score from Experian and used it in making our decision. Your FICO score is a number that reflects the information in your credit report. Your FICO score can change depending on how the information in your credit report changes. On March 3, 2022, your FICO score was 700. The FICO score ranges from 300 to 850. The following are the key factors that contributed to your FICO score:  Ratio of balance to limit on bank revolving or other revolving accts too high Length of time accounts have been established  Time since most recent account opening is too short  Proportion of loan balances to loan amounts is too high  Too many inquiries last 12 months  If you have any questions about your FICO score, please contact the credit agency listed below.
